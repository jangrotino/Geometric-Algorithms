# **Geometric Algorithms**  

This repository contains solutions to labs from the **Geometric Algorithms** course.  

## **Lab 1: Point Position Relative to a Line Segment**  
This lab focuses on determining whether a given point lies **to the left or right** of a line segment.  

## **Lab 2: Convex Hull Algorithms**  
Implementation of **Graham's scan** and **Jarvis's march** algorithms to solve the **Convex Hull** problem.  

## **Lab 3: Monotone Polygon Triangulation**  
This lab covers **triangulation of a monotone polygon**, an essential technique in computational geometry.  

## **Lab 4: Line Segment Intersection (Sweeping Algorithm)**  
Implementation of the **sweep line algorithm** to detect intersections between multiple line segments.  

### **Visualization**  
Visualizations were created using the [**Algorytmy Geometryczne repository**](https://github.com/aghbit/Algorytmy-Geometryczne).
