# Geometric-Algorithms
This repository contains solution to labs from Geomatric Algorithms 
lab1 is about determaining if point is on the right or on the left to line segment
lab2 is about Graham and Jarvis algorihtms for Convex Hull problem
lab3 is about monotone polygon traingulation
lab4 is about line segment intersection using sweeping algorithm
Visualization were made using https://github.com/aghbit/Algorytmy-Geometryczne
